Problem: Plotly Graphs Not Displaying on GitHub

When uploading a Jupyter Notebook to GitHub, Plotly graphs do not display properly. This issue arises because GitHub renders Jupyter Notebooks as static HTML, which does not support interactive Plotly graphs.

Solution:

Using nbviewer:
Use nbviewer to view the notebook with Plotly graphs rendered correctly. 
1. Go to [https://nbviewer.org/]
2. Enter the location of the notebook: [https://github.com/aeyeniay/Plotly_Plots/blob/666b2d9a15a7cde29774a76ef46454b76f03ff5b/Plotly_Plots.ipynb]
